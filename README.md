## Mechanics
Players will be able to move and jump.  Players can hold towards a wall and wall slide.  They can then jump off the wall when wall sliding to perform a wall jump.

Players can find items throughout the level.  Items have primary uses and secondary uses.  Primary uses can be used infinitely and are used for attacking and defending while secondary uses discards the item for a burst of movement to get to unexpected places.  When holding an item which can be found in levels they can use primary item uses which can change depending on which direction the player holds (Forwards,Upwards, Downwards).  Items cannot be used while wallsliding. Items include the sword and bomb.
**Sword**
The Sword can be used to slash forwards, upwards, and downwards (Only in the air).  A timed downward slash will bounce the player like a pogo stick and can be done multiple times.
